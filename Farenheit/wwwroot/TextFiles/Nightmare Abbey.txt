Chapter 4 of Nightmare Abbey by Thomas Love Peacock\n
\n
"Liberty of action, sir? there is no such thing as liberty of action.\n
We are all slaves and puppets of a blind and unpathetic necessity."\n
"Very true, sir; but liberty of action, between individuals, consists in their being differently influenced, \n
or modified, by the same universal necessity; so that the results are unconsentaneous, \n
and their respective necessitated volitions clash and fly off in a tangent." \n
"Your logic is good, sir: but you are aware too, \n
that one individual may be a medium of adhibiting to another a mode or form of necessity, \n
which may have more or less influence in the production of consentaneity; \n
and, therefore, sir, if you do not comply with my wishes in this instance (you have had your own way in every thing else), \n
I shall be under the necessity of disinheriting you, though I shall do it with tears in my eyes." \n
Having said these words, he vanished suddenly, in the dread of Scythrop's logic.
