Chapter 1 of the Prince by Machiavelli:

HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED

There are only two kinds of states, republics or principalities.
Principalities are either hereditary, where the family in control has been long established; or they are new.
The new principalities are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are, as it were,
members added to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples
to that of the King of Spain.
Such states thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom. They are
acquired either by the military power of the prince himself or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
