A section of the Clouds by Aristophanes: 

SOCRATES
    Why, he is but a child yet. He is not used to these baskets, in which we suspend our minds.
PHIDIPPIDES
    To make you better used to them, I would you were hung.
STREPSIADES
    A curse upon you! you insult your master!
SOCRATES
    "I would you were hung!" What a stupid speech! and so emphatically spoken! 
    How can one ever get out of an accusation with such a tone, 
    summon witnesses or touch or convince? And yet when we think, Hyperbolus learnt all this for one talent!
STREPSIADES
    Rest undisturbed and teach him. He has a most intelligent nature. 
    Even when quite little he amused himself at home with making houses, carving boats, constructing little chariots of leather, 
    and understood wonderfully how to make frogs out of pomegranate rinds. 
    Teach him both methods of reasoning, the strong and also the weak, which by false arguments triumphs over the strong; 
    if not the two, at least the false, and that in every possible way.
SOCRATES
    The Just and Unjust Discourse themselves shall instruct him. I shall leave you.
STREPSIADES
    But forget it not, he must always, always be able to confound the true.
    Socrates enters the Thoughtery; a moment later the JUST and the UNJUST DISCOURSE come out; they are quarrelling violently.
JUST DISCOURSE
    Come here! Shameless as you may be, will you dare to show your face to the spectators?
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    Take me where you will. I seek a throng, so that I may the better annihilate you.
JUST DISCOURSE
    Annihilate me! Do you forget who you are?
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    I am Reasoning.
JUST DISCOURSE
    Yes, the weaker Reasoning."
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    But I triumph over you, who claim to be the stronger.
JUST DISCOURSE
    By what cunning shifts, pray?
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    By the invention of new maxims.
JUST DISCOURSE
    .... which are received with favour by these fools.
    He points to the audience.
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    Say rather, by these wise men.
JUST DISCOURSE
    I am going to destroy you mercilessly.
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    How pray? Let us see you do it.
JUST DISCOURSE
    By saying what is true.
UNJUST DISCOURSE
    I shall retort and shall very soon have the better of you. First, maintain that justice has no existence.
JUST DISCOURSE
    Has no existence?
