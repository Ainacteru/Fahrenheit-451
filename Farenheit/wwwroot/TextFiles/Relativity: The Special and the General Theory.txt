Chapter 5 of Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein

Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity. 
Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena, 
still we must grant it a considerable measure of “truth,” since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. 
The principle of relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of mechanics. 
But that a principle of such broad generality should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be invalid for another, is a priori not very probable.

Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second. 
If the principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, 
and also that physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in space with respect to the earth. 
For owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a year, 
the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system K0 throughout the whole year. 
However, the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, 
i.e. a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity.
