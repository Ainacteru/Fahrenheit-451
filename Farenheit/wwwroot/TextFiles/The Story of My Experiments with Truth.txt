Chapter 1 of The Story of My Experiments with Truth by Mahatma Gandhi:

But I worship God as Truth only. I have not yet found Him, but I am seeking after Him. 
I am prepared to sacrifice the things dearest to me in pursuit of thisquest. 
Even if the sacrifice demanded be my very life, I hope I may beprepared to give it. 
But as long as I have not realized this Absolute Truth, so long must I hold by the relative truth as I have conceived it. 
That relative truth must, meanwhile, be my beacon, my shield and buckler. 
Though this path is straight and narrow and sharp as the razorâ€™s edge, for me it has been the quickest and easiest. 
Even my Himalayan blunders have seemed trifling to me because I have kept strictly to this path. 
For the path has saved me from coming to grief, and I have gone forward according to my light. 
Often in my progress I have had faint glimpses of the Absolute Truth, God, and daily the conviction is growing upon me that He alone is real and all else is unreal. 
Letthose, who wish, realize how the conviction has grown upon me; 
let them share my experiments and share also my conviction if they can. 
The further conviction has been growing upon me that whatever is possible for me is possible even for a child, and I have sound reasons for saying so. 
The instruments for the quest of truth are as simple as they are difficult. They may
appear quite impossible to an arrogant person, and quite impossible to an innocent child. The seeker after truth should be humbler than the dust.
