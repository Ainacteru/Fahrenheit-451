Chapter 4 of Analects by Confucius

The Master said, 'Of neighbourhoods benevolence is the most beautiful. How can the man 
be considered wise who, when he has the choice, does not settle in benevolence?'  Lau [4:1]


The Master said, 'One who is not benevolent cannot remain long strained circumstances, 
nor can he remain long in easy circum\ stances. "The benevolent man is attracted to 
benevolence because he feels at home in it. The wise man is attracted to benevolence 
because he finds it to his advantage.'  Lau [4:2]

The Master said, 'it is only the benevolent man who is capable of liking or disliking other men.'  Lau [4:3]

The Master said, 'If a man sets his heart on benevolence, he will be free from evil.'  Lau [4:4]

The Master said, 'Wealth and high station are what men desire but unless I got them in the 
right way I would not remain in them. Poverty and low station are what men dislike, but 
even if I did not get them in the right way I would not try to escape from them. 'If the 
gentleman forsakes benevolence, in what way can he make a name for himself? 
The gentleman never deserts benevolence, not even for as long as it takes to eat a meal. If he 
hurries and stumbles one may be sure that it is in benevolence that he does so.'  Lau [4:5]

The Master said, 'I have never met a man who finds benevolence attractive or a man who 
finds unbenevolence repulsive. A man who finds benevolence attractive cannot be 
surpassed. A man who finds unbenevolence repulsive can, perhaps, be counted as 
benevolent, for he could not allow what is not benevolent to contaminate his person. 'Is 
there a man who, for the space of a single day, is able to devote all his strength to 
benevolence? I have not come across such a man whose strength proves insufficient for the 
task. There must be such cases of insufficient strength, only I have not come across them.'  Lau [4:6]
